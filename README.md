# scripts-and-scraps
random tidbits, laying around my desktop, half-forgotten, but better not be lost!

Ugly helper scripts that I use and (tend to) lose often. Pushing them to github for safekeeping and easier sharing with teammates.

* **Notification distribution:** script for calculation if the distribution of notification sample sizes is correct, an input file with versions is needed
* **Redirects:** checking if redirects are resolved to correct target url's.
* **Translation testing:** opening translated extension pages to visually check if the translated pages look fine
* **UI-builds:** generating ABP builds from UI branches
